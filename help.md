December 25, 2015  

This web application loads the Motor Trend automobile performance data from 
R's built-in dataset "mtcars".

The user uses the slider input to select the desired number of cylinders to 
use in the analysis. 

The system will compute the mean of 4 performance metrics; horse-power (HP),
fuel mileage (mpg), engine displacement, vehicle weight (wt) and update
the corresponding histograms to reflect the user's selection.
