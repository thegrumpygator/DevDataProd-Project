This web application is not associated with motor-trend magazine in any way. 
The data used in the analysis is from the 1974 Motor Trend magazine study of
automobile performance and design for 32 automobiles from the 1973-1974 model
year.


This web application loads the Motor Trend automobile performance data from 
R's built-in dataset "mtcars".

The user uses the slider input in the left side-bar to select the desired number
of cylinders to include in the analysis. 

The system computes the mean of 4 performance metrics; horse-power (HP),
fuel mileage (mpg), engine displacement, vehicle weight (wt) and updates
the corresponding histograms to reflect the user's selection.
